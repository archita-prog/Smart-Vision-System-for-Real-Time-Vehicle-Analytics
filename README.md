CPU-efficient video analysis for surveillance & media applications

Python
YOLOv8
OpenCV
Ultralytics

A high-performance object detection system that processes video streams in real-time using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, optimized for CPU deployment.

 Key Features
Multi-class detection: Identifies 80+ COCO classes (persons, vehicles, etc.) in video feeds.
CPU optimization: Smooth performance without GPU acceleration (~10-15 FPS on Intel i5).
Real-time visualization: Dynamic bounding boxes and labels overlaid using OpenCV.
Deployment-ready: Designed for surveillance, media analysis, and edge devices

Technical Implementation
1. Core Stack
YOLOv8n (Nano variant for CPU efficiency)
OpenCV (Frame processing and visualization)
Ultralytics API (Model loading/inference)

2. Performance Optimizations
Frame skipping for lower-end CPUs
Async processing for batch frames
Non-maximum suppression (NMS) threshold tuning
